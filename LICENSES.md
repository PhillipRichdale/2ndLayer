=============================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE (*NOT* part of the above license, inclusion in copies and/or
forks *NOT* required but perhaps benefitial in certain situations):

The entirety and/or a subset of the 2ndLayer codebase MAY also be available
under alternative licenses or MAY have been granted non-exclusive ownership
to businesses and/or individuals under dual/multiple license and/or
dual/multiple ownership condition. These cases, should they exist or occur,
are however RARE exceptions. The MIT license is the only license under which
2ndLayer is distributed beyond possible NDA conditions of its core contributors
with direct contractors.

In any douptful situtation where actual ownership may be disputed and no
WRITTEN contract can be provided, by entities or individuals, to the contributed
code that PROVE beyond any doubt dual/multiple license and/or dual/multiple
ownership, the MIT License of the 2ndLayer codbase and its subsets takes precedance
and is henceforth the ONLY license under which said 2ndLayer codebase or subset is
allowed to be used or further developed on for the existing sourcecode in question.

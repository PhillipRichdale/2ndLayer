	This is the 2ndLayer configuration file. Please rename it from
	config-dist.php to config.php and configure it to your needs in
	order to get 2ndLayer to function as intended. Do *not* version
	config.php in your projects versioning, ci or build system. Keep
	in mind that configuration differs from development environment
	to development environment to staging, testing and production.
	Thus the config-dist.php filename.

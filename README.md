2ndLayer
========

2ndLayer is a collection of PHP driven web-centric software development tools
and libraries for environments running PHP 5.3 and up. The prime objective of
the 2ndLayer project is to provide professional developers with tools that
significantly speed up day-to-day development work with new and existing projects.

****Requirements****

[PHP](http://php.net/) 5.3+ & [PHP PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php)

A runtime environment with PHP 5.3 and up. Furthermore, all the classes providing DB interaction require the PHP PDO extension to be installed. Quite a few, so see to it that PDO is up and running.

**2ndLayer comes with other awesome free open source software projects - unmodified, but simply bundled for your convenience.**

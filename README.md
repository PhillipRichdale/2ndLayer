2ndLayer
========

2ndLayer is a collection of PHP driven web-centric software development tools
and libraries for environments running PHP 5.3 and up. The prime objective of
the 2ndLayer project is to provide professional developers with tools that
significantly speed up day-to-day development work with new and existing projects.

**2ndLayer comes with other awesome free open source software projects - unmodified, but simply bundled for your convenience:**

**[Polymer Web Components](http://www.polymer-project.org/)**, **[jQuery](http://jquery.org/), [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) & [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)** and the bold and light typefaces of Christian Robertsons [**Font 'Roboto'**](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto).

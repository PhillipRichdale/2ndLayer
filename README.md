The entirety and/or a subset of the 2ndLayer codebase MAY also be available

dual/multiple ownership condition. These cases, should they exist or occur,
are however RARE exceptions. The MIT license is the only license under which

with direct contractors.

In any douptful situtation where actual ownership may be disputed and no

code that PROVE beyond any doubt dual/multiple license and/or dual/multiple
ownership, the MIT License of the 2ndLayer codase and its subsets takes precedance
and is henceforth the ONLY license under which said 2ndLayer codebase or subset is
allowed to be used for the existing sourcecode in question.
